In previous years from 2012 - 2019, Michigan lost to Ohio State eight consecutive years.\nIn 2019 the two teams didn’t play each other due to Covid-19, which was the first time they didn’t face each other since 1918.\n\n\nCode\nrushing &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing1.csv\") \n\n\n\n\nCode\nteamrushing &lt;- rushing |&gt; \n  group_by(Year, School) |&gt; \nsummarise(\n    TotalYards = sum(Yds...5, na.rm = TRUE)\n    )\n\n\nHistorically in Big Ten football, rushing yards are an important factor in the outcome of a game. When a team is running the ball well throughout the length of a game, the offense gains control and the defense becomes physically worn down.\nQuestion: How has rush yards between Ohio State and Michigan affected the outcome of the game over the past 11 years?\n\n\nCode\nuofm &lt;- teamrushing |&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Michigan\")\nosu &lt;- teamrushing |&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Ohio State\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=uofm, aes(x=Year, y=TotalYards), color=\"#00274C\") + \n  geom_line(data=osu, aes(x=Year, y=TotalYards), color=\"#BB0000\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,400)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2012,2023)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Year of Games\", \n    y=\"Total Yards Per Game\", \n    title=\"Michigan improved rush yards, to turn the outcome of the rivalry\", \n    subtitle=\"Michigan's rushing offense has turned into a staple for their team\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Annie Worley\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\", color = \"black\"), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOhio State was out rushing Michigan from 2012 to 2019. Michigan made changes in 2021 and flipped the stats and were out rushing Ohio State.\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"graph.jpeg\")  \n#| messasge: FALSE\n\n\n\n\nCode\npenalties &lt;- read_csv(\"PenaltiesYards1.csv\") \n\n\nUnlike the affects that rushing yards has on the game, penalties do not necessarily affect the outcome. However, in 2021 and 2022 there was a notable difference in the number that may have influenced the results.\nQuestion: Has the amount of penalties each team got, affected the outcome of the game?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=penalties, aes(x=Year, weight=`Total Penalties`, fill=School)) + \n  coord_flip() +\nscale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Michigan\" = \"#00274C\", \"Ohio State\" = \"#BB0000\")) + theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year of Game\", \n    y=\"Total Number of Penalties Per Game\", \n    title=\"Penalties contribute to the help for the last three wins for Michigan\", \n    subtitle=\"In a lot of the games the number of penalties has not been a significant factor\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Annie Worley\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = \"bold\", color = \"black\"), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was not a big impact on those nine loses. In the 2021 and 2022 games Ohio State had a significant number compared to Michigan.\nMichigan across the nine games they lost straight to Ohio State, had at least one turnover every game. The past three games Michigan cleaned up their play and only had one turn over in total. In those nine loses Michigan lost the turn over battle every game except 2013.\nQuestion: How many turnovers did Michigan and Ohio State each have across their past 11 match ups?\n\n\nCode\nturnovers &lt;- read_csv(\"turnovers.csv\") \n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=turnovers, aes(x=Year, weight=Turnovers, fill=School)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_wrap(~School) +\nscale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Michigan\" = \"#00274C\", \"Ohio State\" = \"#BB0000\")) + theme_minimal() +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Year of Game\", \n    y=\"Total Number of Turnovers\", \n    title=\"Michigan has cleaned up their play and reduced the number of turnovers\", \n    subtitle=\"Michigan made the changes to be able to help them dominate\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Annie Worley\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\", color = \"black\"), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s clear Ohio State had too many turnovers in 2022 and 2023 and affected the outcome of the games. Also, Michigan in the earlier games had many turnovers.\nThe data shows Michigan improved their performance in key areas to be able to dominate a good team the last three years. Going forward it may be hard for Michigan to keep up with these statistics due to changes within the coaching staff and key players."
